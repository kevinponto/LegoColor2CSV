This project is a work in progress.  To use, drop an image on the executable.  Once launched, drag the corners to match up with the corners for the Lego stacks.  For fine-tuned manipulations use the A,S,D, and E keys to move the corners around.  When the grid cells look like they match the lego colors, push 'p' to write the results to csv files.
